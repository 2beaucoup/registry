# Registry toolkit

Want to keep track of and work with all fish of a specific type? Meet the RegistryFish pattern.

## scalable, reuseable, composable, and maintainable

One thing that has come up quite a few times is the need to track all fish of a certain kind in someplace. You may have a fish representing a specific entity on your shop-floor. There are going to be many instances of this fish, one for each entity. Now, what if you wanted to show a list of all these entities somewhere?

The registry pattern will lead you to a data model that is **scalable**, **reuseable**, **composable**, and **maintainable**.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Registry toolkit is available as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@actyx-contrib/registry).

```shell
npm install @actyx-contrib/registry
```

## ðŸ“– Example / Tutorials

This library is made to reduce the code you write.
Works well with the [FishType package](https://github.com/actyx-contrib/fish-type)

```typescript
import { FishType } from '@actyx-contrib/fish-type-v2'
import { fromTypes } from '@actyx-contrib/registry-v2'

enum EventType {
    create = 'create',
    delete = 'delete',
}

type Event = { type: EventType, entityId: string }
type State = { entityId: string, state: 'unknown' | 'created' }

const MyFishType = FishType<State, Event>({
    typeName: Tag<Event>('example-tag'),

    getTargetFish: (e: Event) => e.entityId,

    makeInstance: (name: FishName) => ({
        initialState: { entityId: name, type: 'unknown' },

        onEvent: (state, event) => event.type === 'created'
            ? ({ entityId: name, type: 'created' })
            : ({ entityId: name, type: 'unknown' }),
    })
})

const allActiveFish$ = fromTypes.observeAll(MyFishType, EventType.create, EventType.delete)
```
